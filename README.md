`1_damage_fun_estimate.R` has three regressions:


1.   baseline regression from Burke et al (2015);
2.   model with interactive effects + AFE;
3.   model with interactive effects + IFE; (Hande's Code)

`2_econ_control.R` has robustness checks for economic controls.

`3_climate_proj.R` synthesizes Global Climate Model (GCM) projections for future climates until 2100.

`4_GDP_pathway.R` calculates GDP pathways until 2100.

`5_difference_in_GDP_with-without_IE.R` calculates difference in Climate Change impacts on GDP with and without interactive terms.

`6.1_plot_optimal_curves.R` plots optimal curves with scatter points of countries representing current climate in 2019.

`fun_script.R` includes user defined functions.

`/data` is the data folder.
